4,Define a 'dent' as used in damage classification.,A depressed area relative to normal contour with smooth boundaries and no cross-sectional area change; typically from a smoothly contoured object.,51-10-00 Damage Classification: Dent
5,Define a 'crease' in aircraft skin.,A depressed/folded area with sharp well-defined boundaries or ridges; considered equivalent to a crack.,51-10-00 Damage Classification: Crease
6,What is an 'abrasion' per the SRM?,A damaged area of any size causing cross-sectional change due to scuffing/rubbing/scraping; surface is usually rough and irregular.,51-10-00 Damage Classification: Abrasion
7,What is a 'gouge'?,"A damaged area of any size with cross-sectional area change, usually a continuous channel-like groove from a sharp object.",51-10-00 Damage Classification: Gouge
8,How does the SRM define a 'nick'?,A local gouge with sharp edges; a series of nicks in a line pattern is equivalent to a gouge.,51-10-00 Damage Classification: Nick
9,What qualifies as a 'scratch'?,"A line of damage of any depth resulting in cross-sectional area change, typically from a very sharp object.",51-10-00 Damage Classification: Scratch
10,How is a 'crack' defined?,"A partial fracture or complete break with significant cross-sectional area change, usually irregular and from fatigue.",51-10-00 Damage Classification: Crack
11,How does the SRM define 'corrosion' in damage terms?,A damaged area of any size/depth from electrochemical action causing cross-sectional area change; depth determined by cleanup.,51-10-00 and 51-11-00 General
12,"After initial cleaning, what should be inspected beyond the visibly damaged area?","Check primary and secondary structures for transmitted damage (e.g., sheared/stretched rivets, elongated holes, canned skins/bulkheads), including spars if loads indicate.",51-10-00 Damage Investigation
13,What are the three broad categories of damage in the SRM?,"Negligible damage, repairable damage, and major replacement damage.",51-10-00 Damage Classification
14,What are the depth guidelines for 'light' corrosion?,Discoloration or pitting to approximately 0.001 inch maximum depth.,51-11-00 Corrosion Damage Limits
15,What characterizes 'moderate' corrosion?,Similar to light but may include blistering or scaling; pitting depths may be up to 10% of material thickness.,51-11-00 Corrosion Damage Limits
16,What characterizes 'severe' corrosion?,"Blistering/exfoliation, scaling or flaking; pitting may reach ~15% of thickness; usually requires part replacement (or approved patch).",51-11-00 Corrosion Damage Limits
17,List the four conditions required for electrochemical corrosion to occur.,"Anode (corroding metal), cathode (less corrodible metal), electrolyte (liquid path), and a metallic conductor for electron flow.",51-11-00 General (Corrosion conditions)
18,Name three types of corrosion described in the SRM.,"Direct surface attack, pitting, dissimilar-metal (galvanic) corrosion. (Also covered: intergranular, stress corrosion, corrosion fatigue.)",51-11-00 Types of Corrosion
19,How is dissimilar-metal corrosion explained?,Two dissimilar metals in contact and connected by an electrolyte form a galvanic cell; the more active metal (anode) corrodes faster.,51-11-00 Dissimilar Metal Corrosion
20,Where does the SRM recommend looking for corrosion caused by exhaust deposits?,"Lower fuselage aft of engine exhaust: around rivet heads, skin laps, seams, fairings, and inspection covers.",51-11-00 Typical Corrosion Areas
21,What is the primary means of corrosion detection?,"Visual inspection; supplements include dye penetrant, magnetic particle, X-ray, ultrasonic as applicable.",51-11-00 Corrosion Detection
22,How is dye-penetrant inspection described for crack detection?,"A dye seeps into surface openings by capillary action; after developer is applied, dye is drawn out to reveal faults.",51-11-00 Corrosion Detection (Liquid Dye Penetrant)
23,What is one recommended way to prevent corrosion among the four required conditions?,"Apply an organic film (paint/grease/plastic) to block the electrolyte path, preventing current flow and corrosion.",51-11-00 General (Eliminating conditions)
24,What standard methods does the SRM list for corrosion removal?,"Chemical treatments, hand sanding with appropriate abrasives, and mechanical sanding/buffing with abrasive mats—chosen per metal and severity.",51-11-00 Corrosion Removal (Standard Methods)
25,"For aluminum Alclad parts, why must the clad layer be preserved?",Because the pure aluminum cladding provides higher corrosion resistance than the base alloy; avoid unnecessary mechanical removal.,51-11-00 Corrosion Removal (Aluminum and Alloys)
26,Summarize the sequence for treating light/moderate corrosion on aluminum per SRM.,Clean/strip as required; assess depth; remove light by light hand sanding; remove moderate/severe by scraping/rotary file then sand; blend; clean; conversion coat; epoxy prime.,51-11-00 Corrosion Removal (Aluminum and Alloys)
27,What caution is noted for cleaning stainless control cables?,Do not use metallic wool or solvents; they embed dissimilar metals or remove internal lubricant; apply a light coat of VV-L-800 after cleaning.,51-11-00 Typical Corrosion Areas (Stainless Steel Control Cables)
28,What environmental factor significantly accelerates corrosion according to the SRM?,"Presence of salts (e.g., sea-coast operation) increases conductivity of moisture and accelerates attack.",51-11-00 General (Environmental conditions)
29,Which chapter contains general structural information and procedures usable in non-critical areas?,Chapter 51 (Standard Practices—Structures).,INTRODUCTION / Using the SRM (Division of Subject Matter)
30,What does the SRM advise when corrosion damage appears severe or worse?,Contact Cessna Propeller Aircraft Product Support for assistance regarding repair/replace decisions.,51-11-00 Corrosion Damage Limits
