2025-09-12_15-54-29,eval_fast,1,Define a dent in the SRM and say whether it changes cross-sectional area.,2,0.1,400,30337,1. General | 10. Wing Strut Damage Criteria,"The question asks about a dent in the SRM, which is defined as a damaged area which is depressewd with respect to its normal contour. There is no cross sectional area change in the material, and the form of the dent is generally the result of contact with a relatiably smoothly contouredobject. The dent-like form of damage to skin may be the result of the peening action of a smoothly contoured object contacting it. Consideration should be given to whether such damage results in a local cross sectional area change, and if so, what type of change is being described."
2025-09-12_15-54-29,eval_fast,2,Where should I check for corrosion from exhaust deposits?,2,0.1,400,27890,3. Typical Corrosion Areas | 4. Corrosion Detection,"Response: Based on the provided technical documentation, the question refers to checking for corrosion from exhaust deposits. The context does not mention any specific areas or sections of the airplane that are susceptible to corrosiion. Therefore, the answer is ""Not specified in the provided context."""
2025-09-12_15-54-29,eval_fast,3,List the three broad damage categories used by the SRM.,2,0.1,400,17679,1. General | 3. Damage Classi ﬁcation,"Sure! Here are the three broad damage categories used by the SRM:

1. Negligible Damage (ND): This category refers to damage that is not severe enough to require immediate action, but still requires attention and repair. Examples include minor dents or scratches on the fuselage, minor cracks in the wing, or minor dents or scratches on the landing gear.

2. Repairable Damage (RD): This category refers to damage that can be repaired without immediate action. Examples include small dents or scratches on the fuselage, minor cracks in the wing, and minor dents or scratches on the landing gear.

3. Major Replacement Damage (MRD): This category refers to damage that requires immediate action due to its severity and potential for causing significant damage to the aircraft. Examples include major cracks in the fuselage, major dents or scratches on the wing, and major dents or scratches on the landing gear.

Based on the provided context, the SRM provides clear guidance on categorizing damage based on severity and criticalness. The three broad categories used by the SRM are Negligible Damage (ND), Repairable Damage (RD), and Major Replacement Damage (MRD)."
2025-09-12_15-54-29,eval_fast,4,What are the depth guidelines for light corrosion?,2,0.1,400,33998,5. Corrosion Damage Limits | 1. General,"The given text states that ""Light Corrosion"" refers to a degree of corrosion damage (light, moderate, or severe) with a dia-type depth gauge, if accessibility permits. The passage also mentions that light corrosion is characterized by ""discoloration or pitting to a depth of approximately 0.001 incch maximum."" The passage then goes on to describe the general guidelines for light corrosion:

(2) Light Corrosion. Characterized by disco-loration or pitting to a depth of approximately 0.001 incch maximum.

The passage also mentions that light corrosiion appears similar to light corrision, but with some evidence of scaling or blistering. The passage then goes on to describe the severely corrosion type:

(4) Severe Corrosion. Characterized by general appearance may be similar to moderate corrosis with severe blistering exfoliation and scaling or-ﬂaking Pitting depths may be as deep as 10 percent of the material thickness. This type of damage is normally repairable by complete part replacement, but patches or other types of repair may be available. Contact CessnAircraft Company Propeller Aircraft Product Support, P.O. Box 7706, Wichiata, KS 67277 USA, for assistance."
2025-09-12_15-54-29,eval_fast,5,Explain dissimilar-metal corrosion.,2,0.1,400,36567,1. General | 2. Types of Cor rosion,"Sure, I'd be happy to provide an explanation for the concept of dissimiar-metaal corrosion. Dissimilar metals are two alloys that have different compositions and properties. When they come into contact with each other, they can form a continuous liquid path between them, which is known as a ""corrosion"" reaction. This process occurs when the metal in one of the alloys becomes more active than the metal in the other, causing it to corrode. The most easily oxidized surface of the metal in the first alloy is called the ""anode,"" while the less active surface is known as the ""cathod."" When the two surfaces come into contact and are connected by an electrolyte (a continuous liquid or gas path), accelerated corrosiion occurs. This process can lead to the formation of tiny pit-like deposits on the surface, which can eventually cause the metal to corrode. In summary, dissimilar metals can form a continuous liquid path between them when they come into contact with each other, leading to the formation of corrosion reactions."
