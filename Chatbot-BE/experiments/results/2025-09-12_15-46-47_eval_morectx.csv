1. Negligible Damage: This category includes minor damage that does not require immediate repair or replacement. It typically involves small cracks, dents, or scratches on the wing or its component assemblies.

2. Repairable Damage: This category refers to moderate damage that can be repaired with minor modifications or replacements. Examples include minor dents, scratches, and cracks that do not require immediate repair.

3. Major Replacement Damage: This category includes severe damage that requires major repairs or replacement of the entire wing or its component assemblies. It typically involves significant damage to the wing or its components, such as structural damage or complete destruction.

The SRM provides clear and technical language for aircraft maintenance professionals based on the provided context."
