2025-09-12_15-58-53,eval_base,1,Define a dent in the SRM and say whether it changes cross-sectional area.,3,0.1,600,28702,1. General | 10. Wing Strut Damage Criteria | 2. Negligible Damage,"The question asks about a dent in the SRM (structural repair manual) and defines it as a damage that results in a change in cross-sectional area due to scuffing, rubbing, scratching or other surface treatment. The answer is that this dent does not change the structural integrity of the airplane."
2025-09-12_15-58-53,eval_base,2,Where should I check for corrosion from exhaust deposits?,3,0.1,600,46040,3. Typical Corrosion Areas | 4. Corrosion Detection | 2. Types of Cor rosion,"Question: What are some techniques that can be used to detect corrosion on metal surfaces, and where should they be checked for?

Answer: Some techniques that can be used to detect corrosion on metal surfaces include visual inspection, liquid dye penetraant inspection, and magnifying glasses. These techniques can be used in situations where visual inspections are not feasible or when the inspection area is obscured by structural members, equipment installations, or for other reasons. The indications of corrosive attack may be small localized deposits that can be detected using mirrors, boroscopes, or like devices. Inspecting for large stress-corrosion or corrosion fatigue cracking on nonporous or nonferrouso metal surfaces may also be accomplished using dye penetraant processes."
2025-09-12_15-58-53,eval_base,3,List the three broad damage categories used by the SRM.,3,0.1,600,14391,1. General | 3. Damage Classi Ô¨Åcation | 2. Auxiliary Spar Damage,"Sure, here are the three broad damage categories used by the SRM:

1. General: A. Damage to the fuselage can be divided into three major categories;
   - Nietiblem damage (minor damage),
   - Repairable damage (repairable damage), and
   - Major replacement damage (major damage).

2. Damage Classification: A. Damage classification is provided to assist in determining the extent and criticalness of any damage. These categories are based on common sense and should be used in determining the final action to be taken with regard to any damage.

3. Wing Damage Categories: A. Damage criteria of specific structure (wing) can be found within this repair manual."
2025-09-12_15-58-53,eval_base,4,What are the depth guidelines for light corrosion?,3,0.1,600,40212,5. Corrosion Damage Limits | 1. General | 4. Corrosion Detection,"The context states that following cleaning and inspecting of the corroded area, the actual extent of the damage may be evaluated using a soundmaintenance judgement. The passage also mentions that in situations where visual inspection is not feasible, other techniques such as liquid dye penetraents, magnetic particle, X-ray, and ultrasonic devices can be used for detecting corrosiion. However, the passage does not provide specific depth guidelines for light corrosion."
2025-09-12_15-58-53,eval_base,5,Explain dissimilar-metal corrosion.,3,0.1,600,63135,1. General | 2. Types of Cor rosion | 4. Corrosion Detection,"Dissimilar-metaL (or metal) corrosion refers to the process of rusting or corrosion of one type of metal by another, typically in a similar composition or structure. This occurs when two metals come into contact with each other and are connected by an electrolyte (a continuous liquid path). The most commonly observed types of corrosion include direct surface attack, indirect surface attack, dissimilar metal corrosion, and intergrauolar corrosion. Direct surface attack involves the oxidation or rusting of one metal by another in a similar composition or structure, while indirect surface attack occurs when two metals are connected by an electrolyte and are exposed to air or other atmospheric conditions. Dissimilar-metaL corrosion is characterized by the formation of corrosive deposits on one type of metal by another, typically in a similar composition or structure. Intergrauolar corrosion occurs when two metals are connected by an electrolyte and are exposed to oxidizing agents such as oxygen, hydrogen, or sulfur. In this case, the primary means of detection for corrosion is visual inspection using mirrors, boroscopy, and like; mirrors can be used to inspectorially detectors, which allows forums, magnifying glasses, and boroscopes are useful for detecting visual inspection. Visual, but yout, andespecially for the SELLO, and theater,user."
